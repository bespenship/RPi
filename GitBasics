GIT basic workflow (solo project)
  Navigate to parent directory
  [git status] use this frequently to see that everything goes as expected for each step in the process
  [git add <filename>] for each file - avoid using [git add *] to promote frequent synchronization and not add unintended files (i.e. keys)
  [git status]
  [git commit -m "Commit message"] commits changes to HEAD of local working copy
  [git status]
  [git push origin master] sends changes to remote repository
  [git status]
